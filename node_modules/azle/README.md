# Azle (Beta)

TypeScript CDK for the [Internet Computer](https://internetcomputer.org/).

## Disclaimer

Azle may have unknown security vulnerabilities due to the following:

-   Azle does not yet have many live, successful, continuously operating applications deployed to the IC
-   Azle does not yet have extensive automated property tests
-   Azle does not yet have multiple independent security reviews/audits
-   Azle heavily relies on Boa which is [self-proclaimed to be experimental](https://github.com/boa-dev/boa#boa)

## Roadmap

We hope to get to a production-ready 1.0 in 2024. The following are the major blockers to 1.0:

-   QuickJS/SpiderMonkey integration for performance, security, and stability
-   Broad npm package support
-   Extensive automated property testing
-   Multiple independent security reviews/audits
